'It does not mean that other lives don\'t matter and that it does not ' +
'suggest that. It means that there is a particular issue in our society ' +
'that ignores and dismisses the particular issue experiencing by the ' +
'African-American community. Many people do not know that police brutality ' +
'is the main issue against black people. Discrimination still exists in the ' +
'criminal justice system, job search, businesses, education, and every ' +
'where you mostly transact with. Unintentional biases are also common, even ' +
'in journalism. The point about #BlackLivesMatter is to educate people why ' +
'we have these biases that affect every aspect of black life and we must do ' +
'our social responsibility to shut up, listen, educate, take action, rinse ' +
'and repeat.\n\n' +
